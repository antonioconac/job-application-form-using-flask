# Job Application Form

The Job Application Form App is a simple web tool that makes it easy to collect and manage job applications online.<br><br>
Instead of receiving applications by email or paper, this app provides a clean and professional form where applicants can enter their details, such as:<br><br>
• First and last name<br>
• Email address<br>
• Available start date<br>
• Current occupation (employed, unemployed, self-employed, or student)<br><br>

###  When someone submits the form:

• Their information is saved securely in a database, so it can be reviewed later.<br>
• They receive an automatic confirmation email with the details they submitted.<br>
• A success message is shown to let them know their application went through.<br>

### The app is designed to be:

• Simple to use – just fill out the form and hit submit.<br>
• Reliable – all entries are stored safely.<br>
• Professional – applicants immediately receive a confirmation email.<br>

### This makes it a useful tool for:

• Small businesses collecting applications online.<br>
• Recruiters or HR teams who need a lightweight way to track applicants.<br>
• Event organizers or educators who want to gather participant information.<br>
