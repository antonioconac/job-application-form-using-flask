# Job Application Form

<b>The Job Application Form App</b> is a simple web tool that makes it easy to collect and manage job applications online.<br><br>
Instead of receiving applications by email or paper, this app provides a clean and professional form where applicants can enter their details, such as:<br><br>
• First and last name<br>
• Email address<br>
• Available start date<br>
• Current occupation (employed, unemployed, self-employed, or student)<br><br>

###  When someone submits the form:

• Their information is saved securely in a database, so it can be reviewed later.<br>
• They receive an automatic confirmation email with the details they submitted.<br>
• A success message is shown to let them know their application went through.<br>
